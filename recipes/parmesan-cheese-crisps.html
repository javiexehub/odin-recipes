    Add these Parmesan cheese crisps to your charcuterie board, garnish a soup, or use in a salad instead of croutons. I like to use store-bought shredded Parmesan, as it gives the crisps a "lacy" appearance. You can also use freshly-shredded Parmesan, which will melt more easily, and the crisps will have a smoother, filled-in appearance. You can add a light sprinkle of your favorite seasoning to each crisp before baking, for added flavor.

<h2>Ingredients (Servings: 15)</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
    <li>Using a tablespoon, create 16 mounds of cheese, about 2 inches in diameter, spaced at least 1 inch apart, on the prepared baking sheet. Press down on the middle of each mound to make them evenly thick.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is completely melted and edges are browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from the oven to cool for 15 minutes. Remove from baking sheet and store at room temperature in an air-tight container for up to 5 days.</li>
